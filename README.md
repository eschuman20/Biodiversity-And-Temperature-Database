# Creating A Biodiversity and Temperature Database

A subgoal of an Interactive Qualifying Project (A partial fulfillment of a Bachelors of Science Degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute) was to create a method to extract biodiversity data from iNaturalist and temperature data from OpenWeather and send the data to a Google Sheet database. 

For an extensive guide of setting up and maintaining the database, please refer to the instruction manual on our website: xxxxxxxxxxx.
